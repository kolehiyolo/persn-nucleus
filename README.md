This project is me trying to get the coding groove back. I've been in hiatus for a while and I decided to take a look at Frontend Mentor for some quick project to knock out of the part as a starter. As usual, I got a bit excited and decided to do more than what's expected lol. 

I'm taking a ["Learning how to Learn" course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/), and one of the first things taught is the Pomodoro technique. Since then, I've been doing Pomodoro using [this free site I found](https://pomofocus.io/), and turns out [Frontend Mentor has a project about Pomodoro](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/pomodoro-app-KBFnycJ6G). The design is pretty cool as it's pretty modern and minimalist and it's in dark mode (which I'm a sucker for). It also uses Neumorphism which I've used before already.

The design of the project is very very similar to the design of the site I was already using, so the functionalities are familiar to me already. The difference is, there's a to-do list functionality added to the site, and there's no design in the Frontend Mentor project. Luckily, [Frontend Mentor has a project for a To-do List](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW), so my plan is to combine the Pomodoro project with this one.

I'm yet to figure out how exactly I will do this, and right now my plan is to just build the Pomodoro timer. Beyond that I plan to do the following with the app to make it as fleshed-out as an actual web app:
- Calendar tracking all the tasks and the Pomodoro instances I've done and plan to do
- A separate view for the tasks in a Kanban setting
- The tasks having more elaborate fields and characteristics for a powerful sorting and grouping and searching and prioritizing
- Database and authentication integration so users can register and save instances of the site
- A blogging functionality, with the intention of wrapping up a day with a blog
- A graph to visualize relevant data such as Pomodoro frequencies, break frequencies, etc
- Settings to customize colors

These are all that I have so far, but most definitely I will have more to come as that's just how I am. For now, though, my focus is to build the Pomodoro Timer.

I'm excited to be back. Cheers!
